            <i>Nico Di Mattia was born in Cordoba, Argentina.<br>
                    Ever since he was a child, he was attracted to the arts, comic books, animation and narration.<br>
                    In 1998, at the age of 15, he independently published his first comic book.<br>
                    In 2001, he entered the Cinema and TV School at Cordoba´s National University. <br>
                    While studying there, he acted as a script writer, director and postproducer for various short films, most of which emphasized his skills with aesthetic experimentation.<br>
                    It was during his first year at Cordoba´s National University that Nico made his very first “speedpainting”. <br>
                    It was a painting of the poster from “<b>Planet of the Apes</b>“, created on his bedroom wall with acrylics. <br>
                    This process, which he recorded on VHS, was accelerated and musicalized, resulting in a performance that he called “<b>Arte Fusion</b>”.<br>
                    On 2002 he made his first animated short film, and it was selected to be part of the International Animation Festival “Anima 03”.<br>
                    On 2005 he graduated as a Technician Producer In Audiovisual Media and he directed the short fantasy film “La liga de los Imperfectos”, <br>
                    which took part and was awarded in various National and International Film Festivals. He also directed two new animated short films between 2007 and 2008, <br>
                    which are participating of different national and international film festivals.<br>
                    In 2007 Nico received worldwide attention with his performances of “digital speed paintings” posted on his <b>YouTube´s channel</b>, <br>
                    which has thousands of subscribers and more than 80 million of views.<br>
                    He currently works as a freelance illustrator and caricaturist for different business, companies and private clients from all over world.</i><hr width="840px">
